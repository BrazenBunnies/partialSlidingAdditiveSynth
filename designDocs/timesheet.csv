11/15/2022,11:00AM,11:30AM,SET,set up most of the code files as well as more miscellaneous files like this one
11/15/2022,03:30PM,04:30PM,SAS,it makes more sense to create a wave class than one for fundamental with partial subclass
11/15/2022,09:30PM,11:30PM,PPS,struggled a good deal with structuring the partial shifts but I think I have a decent idea?
11/15/2022,11:30PM,11:15PM,SAS,SAS working but needs cleanup and better file handling
11/18/2022,05:00PM,05:30PM,SAS,created MIDI note-based generation instead of frequency-based generation. list updating is not as slow as expected
11/18/2022,07:30PM,08:30PM,SAS,unfocused work. on a shift at my job. got portamento started using SigTo. for loops still pretty fast
11/18/2022,09:30PM,10:00PM,SAS,debugging portamento
11/19/2022,10:30AM,11:30PM,SAS,fixed portamento. adding comments and getting some graphics up
11/19/2022,06:30PM,09:30PM,SAS,BIG optimization with keypresses, cleaner AND faster :)
