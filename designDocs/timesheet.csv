11/15/2022,11:00AM,11:30AM,SET,set up most of the code files as well as more miscellaneous files like this one
11/15/2022,03:30PM,04:30PM,SAS,it makes more sense to create a wave class than one for fundamental with partial subclass
11/15/2022,09:30PM,11:30PM,PPS,struggled a good deal with structuring the partial shifts but I think I have a decent idea?
11/15/2022,11:30PM,12:00AM,SAS,SAS working but needs cleanup and better file handling
11/18/2022,05:00PM,05:30PM,SAS,created MIDI note-based generation instead of frequency-based generation. list updating is not as slow as expected
11/18/2022,07:30PM,08:30PM,SAS,unfocused work. on a shift at my job. got portamento started using SigTo. for loops still pretty fast
11/18/2022,09:30PM,10:00PM,SAS,debugging portamento
11/19/2022,10:30AM,11:30PM,SAS,fixed portamento. adding comments and getting some graphics up
11/19/2022,06:30PM,09:30PM,SAS,BIG optimization with keypresses. cleaner AND faster :)
11/19/2022,11:30PM,02:00AM,SAS,getting a lot of UI elements in. keyreleased not working
11/20/2022,10:00AM,12:00PM,SAS,working on spectrum analyzer. stopped to get SigTo out in app and realized there's no fundamental
11/20/2022,02:00PM,04:00PM,SAS,just cleaning up some things for TP1. locked aspect ratio
11/23/2022,04:00PM,05:00PM,PPS,restructuring the modes to be more flexible and take user values
11/23/2022,09:30PM,11:00PM,PPS,gave in to OOP. modes now have a class!
11/24/2022,04:00PM,05:00PM,PPS,adding some more modes and freed up time-based tkinter events
11/26/2022,03:00PM,08:00PM,CUG,lots of gui work today. started interactives classes
11/27/2022,01:30PM,02:30PM,PPS,something broke. python keeps crashing. solved: i changed one thing to SigTo but not the updater function. built random mode
11/27/2022,03:30PM,04:30PM,PPS,AND IT WORKS!!! the most difficult part of this project is working. still needs cleanup and GUI but DAMN!
11/28/2022,08:00PM,10:30PM,CUG,worked a good deal on the button and dropdown classes and added powers and primes modes
